	I love Coffee, always thought 𝗆𝗒 𝖽𝗋𝖾𝖺𝗆 was to be a 𝖼𝗈𝗌𝗆𝗈𝗅𝗈𝗀𝗂𝗌𝗍 at NASA sipping 𝗆𝗒 tasse de 𝖼𝖺𝖿é (of course not in space!) and scrolling through hours of space articles. 
	It 𝗌𝖾𝖾𝗆𝖾𝖽 like an appropiate 𝖽𝗋𝖾𝖺𝗆, I've had since 𝗆𝗂𝖽𝖽𝗅𝖾 school. I 𝗌𝗎𝖻𝗆𝖾𝗋𝗀𝖾𝖽 deep into space books for hours to 𝖼𝗈𝗆𝖾. But in the end, I couldn't keep up with it. Well, 
	now it all 𝖼𝖺𝗆𝖾 down to 𝗆𝗒 second interest, Video 𝗀𝖺𝗆𝖾𝗌. For 𝗆𝖾 they were a great way to reduce 𝗆𝗒 stress, and soon enough, I got 𝗆𝗈𝗋𝖾 𝗂𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝖾𝗌𝗍𝖾𝖽 𝗂𝗇 "𝖧𝗈𝗐 𝖳𝗁𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗌 𝖶𝗈𝗋𝗄 𝖡𝖾𝗁𝗂𝗇𝖽 𝖺 𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗀𝗋𝖺𝗆." 
	As High School had a 𝖼𝗈𝗆𝗉𝗎𝗍𝖾𝗋 science subject, I opened that Python book for the first 𝗍𝗂𝗆𝖾 in 𝗆𝗒 life. thought as If I've found what I've been looking for. Since then, I could'nt get enough of it. Today, 𝖨’𝗆 still doing
	what I love.</p>
